Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

My To-Do List uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS)
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/about)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/about)

Some dev-dependencies (so, not for Production):
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about)
- [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)
- [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)


And of course To-Do-List itself is open source with a [public-repository](https://github.com/mnemoakina/mytodolist.git)
 on GitHub.

## Installation

```sh
Just open this app in your web browser and enjoy! (run index.html if you have a folder with the files or if you cloned from Github).
```
